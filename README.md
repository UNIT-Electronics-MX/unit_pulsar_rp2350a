![UNIT PULSAR RP2350A V1.0.0](resources/top_0v1.png)

We are currently working on the design of this new development board, **UNIT PULSAR RP2350A**, at UNIT Electronics.  
This compact NANO-format board is based on the **RP230A** microcontroller and is part of the PULSAR series â€” designed for rapid prototyping, embedded systems education, and low-power applications.

Stay tuned for upcoming updates, including schematics, documentation, and hardware files.  
Our goal is to provide comprehensive resources that support your development process with the UNIT PULSAR RP2350A.
